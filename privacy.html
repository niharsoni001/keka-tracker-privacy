  <h1>üõ°Ô∏è Privacy Policy ‚Äì Keka Time Tracker Extension</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Enter Date]</p>

  <p>This Chrome Extension ("Extension") is designed to enhance your experience with the <strong>Keka</strong> time tracker by extracting and analyzing your in/out timings from the Keka web interface to provide insights such as <em>Total Office Time</em>, <em>Break Time</em>, and <em>Expected Exit Time</em>.</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.</p>
  <p>All data processed by this extension (such as timestamps visible on your Keka dashboard) remains entirely <strong>within your browser</strong> and is used solely to generate insights for your personal view.</p>

  <h2>2. Local Storage Usage</h2>
  <p>The extension may use Chrome's <code>local.storage</code> feature to temporarily save session-related data (e.g., your computed office timings). This information is <strong>not shared</strong> or sent anywhere and is only used to display insights during your session.</p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Access</h2>
  <p>We do not share any information with third parties. The extension operates <strong>independently</strong> and does not integrate with any external service or API.</p>

  <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
  <p>This extension requests access only to the <strong>Keka web page's content</strong> to read your clock-in/clock-out data and display it meaningfully. It does not track any other websites or user behavior outside Keka.</p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>We follow best practices to ensure that your information is safe and confined to your browser environment. No network requests are made by this extension to transmit your data.</p>
